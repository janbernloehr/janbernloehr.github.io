### about me

I am a Software Engineer at [Bosch](https://www.bosch.com) working on highly autonomous vehicles. Previously, I received my PhD from the [I-MATH](http://math.uzh.ch) of the [University of Zurich](http://www.uzh.ch) under supervision of [T. Kappeler](https://www.math.uzh.ch/index.php?id=professur&L=&key1=113&key2=&key3=&keySemId=) where I worked on [completely integrable PDEs](academia).
