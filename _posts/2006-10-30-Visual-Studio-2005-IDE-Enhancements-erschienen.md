Am Freitag hat Microsoft ein [Set von Erweitungen für Visual Studio 2005](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=cd7c6e48-e41b-48e3-881e-a0e6e97f9534&DisplayLang=en) veröffentlicht.

Das Set besteht aus 5 Erweiterungen:

**Source Code Outliner**: The Source Outliner tool is a Visual Studio extension that provides a tree view of your source code's types and members and lets you quickly navigate to them inside the editor.  
****

**Visual C++ Code Snippets**: The Visual C++ Code Snippets tool lets you insert snippets in your code by using a pop-up menu that contains programming keywords. VB.NET and C# languages have this functionality in Visual Studio 2005.   

**** 

**Indexed Find**: The Indexed Find tool is a Visual Studio extension that uses the Microsoft Indexing Service to provide improved Search capabilities to the integrated development environment (IDE). It sends the results of a search to the Output Window.  

**** 

**Super Diff Utility**: The Super Diff Find tool is a Visual Studio extension that compares text files. It uses color coding and graphics to show the difference between the files in deleted text (red), changed text (blue), inserted text (green).

****

**Event Toaster Utility**: The Event Toaster tool is a Visual Studio extension that notifies users about specific events within the Visual Studio IDE.
