Today I downloaded **Microsoft Office 2007 Professional Plus Beta 2**. 

RSS blogging support and the new data visualization features are very cool. Unfortunately the installation didn’t remove my Office 2003 correctly and Office 2007 is unstable and slow 

Besides I really miss the ribbon in Outlook. Although it wouldn’t be that powerful as it is in Word it looks like Microsoft forgot something … 

Nevertheless its great new Ui with animations everywhere make testing efforts easy. 

Go ahead and download it: [http://www.winfuture.de/](http://www.winfuture.de/)
